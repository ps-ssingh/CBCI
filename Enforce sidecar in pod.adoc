Making injection explicit
 -  By default, injection is implicit and applies to all pods created in the labeled namespace(s). However, you can alternately enable injection on only the pod(s) that explicitly require it.

 - To make injection explicit for a given pod:

 - Edit the sidecar-injector-webhook-configmap configmap and specify requiresExplicitInjection: true.

 - To enable injection on a specific pod, annotate the pod with com.cloudbees.sidecar-injector/inject: yes.
